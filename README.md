# Project: Analysis of MTN Cote d'Ivoire Telecom Data

## Introduction
This project focuses on the preparation and analysis of telecom data from MTN Cote d'Ivoire. We will perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis to derive meaningful insights from the dataset. Here's an overview of the key steps in our analysis.

### 1. Importing Libraries and Data
We begin by importing essential libraries, such as numpy and pandas, to facilitate data preparation and analysis. We will load multiple datasets containing telecom information for further exploration.

### 2. Data Cleaning
In this section, we perform data cleaning tasks to ensure the datasets are ready for analysis. We address issues like missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting to create a clean and reliable dataset.

### 3. Data Analysis
Our analysis includes exploring telecom usage patterns, identifying average usage values for voice, data, and SMS, and finding the most significant usage values for each day. We also examine unique cell IDs and calculate variances within the dataset.

### 4. Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into MTN Cote d'Ivoire's telecom data. Our analysis helps us understand usage patterns and trends, enabling data-driven decision-making.
